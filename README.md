# PYTHON_FaceRecognition

Actually, I learn this tutorial by watching this http://bit.ly/2Zfiao2 and try to make somekind of improvements. But it is not working well. In my opinion maybe because the training data (my picture) is not relevant with the life camera. I used a glass in some pictures data, but I did not import the cv2 glass library. You can use your own picture


Enjoy the Deep Learning ;)
